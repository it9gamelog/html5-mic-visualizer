# HTML5 Mic Visualizer

This page uses the HTML5 [`AudioContext.createAnalyser()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/createAnalyser) API to visualize the input audio of your device microphone.

Please select the input device. The selection will be remembered in SessionStorage. Click the screen again to reselect the device.

A demo page can be found [here](https://gitcdn.link/repo/it9gamelog/html5-mic-visualizer/master/index.html). It works in modern versions of desktop browsers, as well as in iOS and Android.
